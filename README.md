# 2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science-principles
A 2nd semester follow-up to the TEALS Intro CS course

Welcome to the TEALS Intro to Computer Science Part 2 Curriculum.
This curriculum is intended for use by TEALS classrooms teaching Introduction to Computer Science in a yearlong format. We expect that students have completed the content from the [1st semester course](https://www.gitbook.com/book/teals-introcs/introduction-to-computer-science-principles/details) prior to this curriculum.

**This curriculum is still under heavy revision**

Please help us complete it by contributing feedback and suggestions via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/TEALS-IntroCS/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science-principles) that contains the source files for this gitbook: https://github.com/TEALS-IntroCS/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science-principles



# Issues

Please open an issue in GitHub if you encounter factual, spelling, or grammatical errors, sequencing problems (topics needed before they are taught), or incomplete/missing materials.


# Suggestions
If you'd like to suggest changes or additions to the curriculum, please submit a Github Pull Request containing your changes. As a best practice, each pull request should contain a singular atomic change.
