#A list is a sequence

Like a string, a list is a sequence of values. In a string, the values are characters; in a list, they can be any type. The values in a list are called elements or sometimes items.

There are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to enclose the elements in square brackets ([ and ]):
```
[10, 20, 30, 40]
['crunchy frog', 'ram bladder', 'lark vomit']
```

The first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of three strings. The elements of a list don’t have to be the same type. The following list contains a string, a float, an integer, and (lo!) another list:
```
['spam', 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]
```
A list within another list is nested.
A list that contains no elements is called an empty list; you can create one with empty brackets, [].

As you might expect, you can assign list values to variables:
```
>>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']
>>> numbers = [17, 123]
>>> empty = []
>>> print cheeses, numbers, empty
['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] [17, 123] []
```

# Lists are mutable

The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for accessing the characters of a string—the bracket operator. The expression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the indices start at 0:
```
>>> print cheeses[0]
Cheddar
```

Unlike strings, lists are mutable. When the bracket operator appears on the left side of an assignment, it identifies the element of the list that will be assigned.
```
>>> numbers = [17, 123]
>>> numbers[1] = 5
>>> print numbers
[17, 5]
```

The one-eth element of numbers, which used to be 123, is now 5.
You can think of a list as a relationship between indices and elements. This relationship is called a mapping; each index “maps to” one of the elements. Figure 10.1 shows the state diagram for cheeses, numbers and empty:

Lists are represented by boxes with the word “list” outside and the elements of the list inside. cheeses refers to a list with three elements indexed 0, 1 and 2. numbers contains two elements; the diagram shows that the value of the second element has been reassigned from 123 to 5. empty refers to a list with no elements.

List indices work the same way as string indices:

Any integer expression can be used as an index.
If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get an IndexError.
If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the end of the list.
