## Instructor's Note

1. Hand out syllabus and IDE Signup sheet
2. Syllabus
	1. Make sure to note the goals for the course: create a functioning Python program, learn basic data types, use a typed language
	2. Present Demo or show program written in Python
3. IDE/Python intro
	1. Python
		1. Python: a programming language, written, uses tabbing to control execution
		2. Show Python code [Python Code], ask the students to write down at least 3 things they noticed about it. Discuss what the students noticed point out written language, indentation, 
	2. IDE
		1. interactive development environment
		2. For Python, cannot use a drag and drop blocks. Needs to be typed. Can write Python in many different ways (even a plain text document),
		3. Show online IDE and where different parts are. Run demo Python code from before
4. Have kids create accounts and set up IDE
	1. Hand out the IDE Guide. This explains signing up for the IDE step by step. Make sure to update this with your account information so that the students share the account with the correct names. 
	2. Have students save their username and password on the paper and/or take a photo on their phones so they donâ€™t forget
	3. Display [Python Code] and have students copy the file into a hello_word.py file and 'turn in'. If you want to have a convention for file name saving make sure to update it in [Python Code].
