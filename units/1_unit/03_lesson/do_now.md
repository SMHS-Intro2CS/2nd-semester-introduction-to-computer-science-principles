Open and save a new file called `my_file.py` in the IDE. Run a program by typing `python3 my_file.py` into the terminal. See the instructions below for how to open, save, and run a file in Cloud9.

Practice typing the following expressions in the editor and running the code. 
 
`2 * 3 * 5`

Now try typing the statement below into the file. Save and run the code. 
```python
print(2*3*5)
