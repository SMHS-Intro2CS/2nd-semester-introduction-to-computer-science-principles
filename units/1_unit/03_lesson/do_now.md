## Do Now
Now, open and save a new file called 'my_file.py' in the IDE. Run a program by typing `python3 my_file.py` into the terminal. Practice typing the following expressions and  running. Write down what you tried and what happened.
 
`2 * 3 * 5`
<br>
`"abc"`
<br>
'"abc" + "bde"'
<br>

Now try typing the following into the file. Save and run. 
```
print(2*3*5)
```
What happens? What do you think `print` does. Try printing out different values.
