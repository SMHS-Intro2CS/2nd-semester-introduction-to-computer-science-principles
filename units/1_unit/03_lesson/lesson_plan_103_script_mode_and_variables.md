# Lesson Plan 1.03: Script Mode and Variables

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: Script, print, run, output, variable
* Write a simple script and run it in IDE
* Print values out to the console (composed values and from variables) 
* Compare script mode vs interactive mode
* Know how to store a value into a variable

## Deliverables
* written worksheet with predictions and results

##Materials/Preparation
* [Worksheet]
* Read through the handout and lesson so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Note
1. Pass out the Do Now (Attached to worksheet), make sure that students are working 
2. Printing Discussion 
	1.	File is the center section of the screen. Sometimes this is called a script.
		1. How do you save/run a file? Ask students what happened when they ran the file from the do now.
		2. Need to use `print` statement. Prints whatever is in between the parenthesis to the console
			1. This is called output
		3. When text appears on console its called output 
		4. What happened when you used multi-lines?
			1. Talk to students about how to read a program. 
	2.	display `Print(“hello world”)` on board. Ask what will hapen when run? Ask students how they would print the following:
	```
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
	```
	3. Have students work on printing practice on the worksheet
3. Variables
	1. variable: a name that refers to a value
	2. an assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values: 
	
	```
	>>> message = 'And now for something completely different'
	>>> n = 17
	>>> pi = 3.1415926535897932
	```
		1. ask the students what they think the assignment operator is. What are the variables, what are the values? 
2. Lab (Attached to worksheet)
    1. Ask students to predict outputs of interpreter 
    2. Ask students about data types: integer, floats, integer
    3. Make sure students do the first part at their desk before going to the computer 
3. Debrief
	1. Discuss any surprising results. 
	2. Discuss why it might be helpful to have an interactive console? How is it different than snap? 
	3. Compare how Python handles variables to how SNAP! handles
4. Opportunities for more
    1. If students are moving quickly, have students practice higher order-of-operations problems. Ask students to come up with a way to print two lines with only one print statement. Allow for students to Google the `\n` character.
