# Worksheet 1.03
## Printing Practice 

Practice typing out some statements in the editor part of the IDE, then hit "Run" at the top of the screen:

| Expression | Expected Output | Did anything unexpected happen? |
|------------|-----------------|--------|
|`print(“1”)`|                 |        |
|`print(1)`|                   |        |
|`print(1 + 2)`|               |        |
|`print(“1” + “2”)`|           |        |
|`print(“this” + “ “ + “is” + “ “ + “a” + “ “ + “sentence” + “.”)`|              |   |        |
