## Printing Practice 

Practice typing out some statements:
| Expression | Expected Output | Output
1.	print(“1”)
2.	print(1)
3.	print(1 + 2)
4.	print(“1” + “2”) 
5.	print(“this” + “ “ + “is” + “ “ + “a” + “ “ + “sentence” + “.”)

##Bonus
How would you print out the following only using one print statement? Feel free to use online resources.

```

## Variables Practice
Practice typing out the following? 
1. 
    ```
    animal = "dogs"
