# Worksheet 1.03
## Printing Practice 

Practice typing out some statements:

| Expression | Expected Output | Did anything unexpected happen? |
|------------|-----------------|--------|
|`print(“1”)`|                 |        |
|`print(1)`|                   |        |
|`print(1 + 2)`|               |        |
|`print(“1” + “2”)`|           |        |
|`print(“this” + “ “ + “is” + “ “ + “a” + “ “ + “sentence” + “.”)`|                 |        |

##Bonus
How would you print out the following only using one print statement? Feel free to use online resources.
```
Wow!
This is on a new line! 
```

## Variables Practice
Practice typing out the following? 
1. 
    ```
    animal = "dogs"
    print(animal + " are really cool.")
    ```

What happens? How would you make the program print out "cats are really cool" instead. 


2.  
```
print(dogs + " are cool.")
```
What happens? Why does this happen?

3. Rewrite the following SNAP! program in Python:
