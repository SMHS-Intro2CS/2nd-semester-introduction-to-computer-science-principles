## Lab 1.04
# Magic Genie

Goals: Use Python to interact with variables and user input. 

Create a genie program. Save the file as magic_genie.py. 

1. have the program introduce itself. Then have the program ask for three separate wishes. Finally print all the wishes together. ![magic_genie_output]()

2.  There are some repeated strings in genie program. Move those into variables.   

3.  Without updating current code, only adding in code, make your genie confused. Have him print your first wish as your last wish, and your second wish as your first wish, and your third wish as your second wish.  

### Hint 
Remember to add spaces you can combine `" "`  to the end of your string using the `+` operator. So `print("hello" + " " + "student")` would print `hello student`
