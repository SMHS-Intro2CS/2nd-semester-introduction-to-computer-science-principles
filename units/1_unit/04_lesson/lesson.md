# Lesson Plan 1.04: Variables and User Input

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **comments**, **storing**, **mutable and variable assignment**,** input**
* Assign and swap variables
* Store user input into a variable

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Worksheet]
* Read through the Do Now, Worksheet, and lesson so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Pacing Guide
| **Duration**   |     **Description**    |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now             |
| 25 Minutes  | Continue Do Now & Discussion |
| 20 Minutes | Magic Genie Lab|
| 5 Minutes | Discussion         |

## Instructor's Note
1. **Do Now**
    * Make sure that students are working as soon as they get to class. 
2. **Do Now Work & Discussion**
	* Input Discussions
		*	Discuss answers to the questions written in the Do Now. 
		*	Explain that *comments* are not executed by the interpreter
		*	Discussion Questions: 
		    *	What did `input` do? 
		    *	What did the string between the parentheses do? 
		    *	What would changing that string do? (it changes the prompt given to the user) 
		* Define *Input*: user data given to the app. 
		* Explain that in Python `input` lets a program take input from the terminal and use it in the code. Recall using input from snap.
		* On board display ![Snap Input](snap_input.png)
			* Ask students what things from Python they will need to create this program. 
			* Ask students to take 3 minutes to convert this to Python.
			* Call some students up to write their answers on the board.
			* Practice changing the argument to input function in class. (ex. How would you have the computer ask what month the students were born in?)
	2.	Swapping Variables Discussion
		1.	If students were not able to complete this section during the Do Now have them work on it for 5 minutes. 
		2.	Ask how the students tried to get it to print in the correct order?
			1.	Have students write answers on the board. If no one volunteers. Ask for line by line and you draw on board or type out. 
		3.	Discuss the idea of setting variables to be other values. 
			1.	What happens if you set variable `c` to `a`. `print(c)`, `print(a)` 
			2.	What would happen if you donâ€™t store a into c in this program? 
			3.	*Mutability*: you can change an existing value
3.  Lab
	*	Make sure students feel comfortable saving things as variables and can print multiple things.
	*	Troubleshoot with students and try to recognize which students are struggling early.
3.	Discussion + Quiz Prep
	1.	Discuss any issues that came up in magic genie
		1.	Any error messages? 
	2.	Anyone use more than one variable? 
		1.	How was the making the genie confused. Did everyone get it organized? 
	3.	Review concepts so far: variables, interpreter, terminal, string, integer, run, output, swapping
