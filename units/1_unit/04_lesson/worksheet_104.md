## Do Now
Type in the following code: 

```
a = input(“What is your name? ”)
# a = “cats and dogs”
# meow
print(“Hello there, ” + a)
```

What do you expect the result to be? What is the result? What does the ‘#’ do? What does input do?

## Swapping
Type in the following code: 

```
a = “this sentence should go second”
b = “this sentence should go first.”  
c = a 
a = b 
# your code starts here

# your code ends here
print(a)
print(b)
```

What is the result? 


Add code in between the “your code starts here” and the “your code ends here” lines try to make the result be in the correct order. Don’t just retype the sentences.
