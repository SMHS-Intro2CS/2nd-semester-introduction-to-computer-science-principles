# Lesson Plan 1.05: Quiz & Debugging

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...
* Demonstrate their understanding of key concepts covered up to this point
* Define and identify: **syntax errors, runtime errors, semantic errors**
* Analyze and respond to error messages

##Materials/Preparation
* [Quiz]
* Take the quiz and create a scoring rubric
* Look through [debugging] web tutorial and example [code] to prepare students for analyzing and responding to errors

## Pacing Guide
| **Duration**   |     **Description**    |
| ---------- | ------------------ |

## Instructor's Note
1. **Welcome and Review**
    * Ask students for any final questions before passing out the quiz.
2. **Quiz**
3. **Debugging Activity**
	1. Talk to students about how to read through code.
		1. Give students a longer piece of code (eg [code]). Ask them to read through it and say what is printed out
		2. When reading through code we go line by line, as if we are the interpreter. It is also helpful to run the code, and look at the error message given back.
		3. Display a stack trace. Ask students what line of code they think the error message might be on. Walk through the stack trace.
	2. Direct students work through this web tutorial on [debugging]
