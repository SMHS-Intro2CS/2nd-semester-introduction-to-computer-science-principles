## Instructor's Note
1. Pass out the quiz
2. Have students start the quiz.
3. Debugging Activity
	1. Talk to students about how to read through code.
		1. Give students a longer piece of code (eg [code]). Ask them to read through it and say what is printed out
		2. When reading through code we go line by line, as if we are the interpreter. It is also helpful to run the code, and look at the error message given back.
		3. Display a stack trace. Ask students what line of code they think the error message might be on. Walk through the stack trace.
	2. Have students work through this web page at [debugging]
