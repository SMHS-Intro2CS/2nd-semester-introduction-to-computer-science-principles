#Lesson 1.06: Mad Libs

##Learning Objectives
* Apply basic Python knowledge about inputs/outputs and variables to create a game of madlibs
* Practice good debugging skills

## Materials/Preparation
* [Project Spec]
* [Mad Libs - Example Code]
* Create a list of possible parts of speech for students to use (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, proper noun, etc)
* Practice running the example code
* Read through the project specifications so that you can completely communicate the requirements of the project

## Instructors Notes
1.  **Project Overview**
    *  Introduce students to the Mad Lib concept by using a short, written out Mad Lib on the whiteboard, poster paper, or projector.
    *  Pass out and the project specification and walk students through all the requirements and potential challenges.
    *  Emphasize that prompts must ask for the correct noun-verb combinations.
    *  Encourage students to look at the grading rubric on page two repeatedly throughout the project to ensure they are meeting all the requirements.
    *  Demo a sample project [solution](project.py) for students to see how a completed program should function.
    * Identify the sub problems of Mad Libs
        * Have students list what variables, inputs, and print statements they will need  
2.  **Project Work**
    *  This project is a summative assessment for the unit. Students should be demonstrating mastery of all the skills covered.
    *  Most students will require roughly 1 hour of total work time to complete the project
    *  Assess the progress of your students regularly using such techniques as asking them to demonstrate their incomplete programs, tracking questions asked during lab time, and/or utilizing peer reviews.
    *  Adjust the amount of time allowed for the project to fit the needs of your students
        *  It is vital that nearly all students complete the project before moving on
    * If most students have the ability to work on assignments at home, the amount of in-class time provided can be reduced if necessary.
        *  If this approach is taken, be sure to make accommodations for students who not able to work at home, such as after school lab hours
    *  Ensure that students are able to ask questions in class throughout the project
3. **Wrap Up - Student Demos**
    * Celebrate and showcase student work once projects are completed. 
        *  Have students demonstrate their Mad Libs for the class, with the class choosing what nouns/verbs/etc to use for the story.

###Accommodation/Differentiation
Ask students to research casting. Have them add, subtract, or multiply values as part of the story.
