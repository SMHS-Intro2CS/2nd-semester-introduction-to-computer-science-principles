## Instructors Notes
1.  Introduce Project
    1.  Walk students through project specification, pointing out important details, potential pitfalls, and specific requirements
    2.  Practice using a written out madlib 
    3.  Prompts must ask for the correct noun verb combo 
    4.  Encourage students to look at the grading rubric on page two repeatedly throughout the project to ensure they are meeting all the requirements
    5.  Demo the project solution
2.  Project Review (if needed)
    1. Identify the sub problems of MadLibs
        1. Have students list what variables, inputs, and print statements they will need  
3.  Project
    1.  This project is a summative assessment for the unit. Students should be demonstrating mastery of all the skills covered.
    2.  Most students will require roughly 1 hour of total work time to complete the project
    3.  Assess the progress of your students regularly using such techniques as asking them to demonstrate their incomplete programs, tracking questions asked during lab time, and/or utilizing peer reviews.
    4.  Adjust the amount of time allowed for the project to fit the needs of your students
        1.  It is vital that nearly all students complete the project before moving on
    5. If most students have the ability to work on assignments at home, the amount of in-class time provided can be reduced if necessary.
    6.  If this approach is taken, be sure to make accommodations for students who not able to work at home, such as after school lab hours
    7.  Ensure that students are able to ask questions in class throughout the project
4. Accommodation/Differentiation
    1. Ask students to research casting. Have them add, substract, or multiply values as part of the story.
