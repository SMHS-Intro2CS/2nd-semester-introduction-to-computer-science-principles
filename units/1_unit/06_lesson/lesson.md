#Lesson 1.06: Mad Libs

##Learning Objectives
* Apply basic Python knowledge about inputs/outputs and variables to create a game of madlibs
* Practice good debugging skills

## Materials/Preparation
* [Mad Libs Example Code]
* [Project Spec]
* Create a list of possible parts of speech for students to use (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, proper noun, etc)
* Practice running the example code
* Read through the project specifications so that you can completely communicate the requirements of the project

## Instructors Notes
1.  **Project Overview**
    *  Introduce students to the Mad Lib concept by using a short, written out Mad Lib on the whiteboard, poster paper, or projector.
    *  Pass out and the project specification and walk students through all the requirements and potential challenges.
    *  Emphasize that prompts must ask for the correct noun-verb combinations.
    *  Encourage students to look at the grading rubric on page two repeatedly throughout the project to ensure they are meeting all the requirements.
    *  Demo a sample project [solution](project.py) for students to see how a completed program should function.
    * Identify the sub problems of Mad Libs
        * Have students list what variables, inputs, and print statements they will need  
3.  **Project Work**
    1.  This project is a summative assessment for the unit. Students should be demonstrating mastery of all the skills covered.
    2.  Most students will require roughly 1 hour of total work time to complete the project
    3.  Assess the progress of your students regularly using such techniques as asking them to demonstrate their incomplete programs, tracking questions asked during lab time, and/or utilizing peer reviews.
    4.  Adjust the amount of time allowed for the project to fit the needs of your students
        1.  It is vital that nearly all students complete the project before moving on
    5. If most students have the ability to work on assignments at home, the amount of in-class time provided can be reduced if necessary.
    6.  If this approach is taken, be sure to make accommodations for students who not able to work at home, such as after school lab hours
    7.  Ensure that students are able to ask questions in class throughout the project

###Accommodation/Differentiation
    1. Ask students to research casting. Have them add, substract, or multiply values as part of the story.
