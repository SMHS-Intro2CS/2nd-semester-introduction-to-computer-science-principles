#Lesson 2.01: Binary Day

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...
* Define and identify: **binary**
* Describe different representations of data
* Represent decimal numbers in binary

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* Index cards for binary activity (at least 1 per student)
* Scissors
* 8.5" x 11" printer paper, each page has a large number (2^n) written on it (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...)
* Read through the do now and lesson so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students as needed

## Instructor's Notes
1. **Do Now**
  * Project [Do Now] questions on the screen
    * Have students discuss how they used their fingers to count to 10, compared to how they counted to 1023.
2. **Lesson/Activity**
  * Explain *binary* compared to decimal: it is a different base of counting, specifically base-2. 
    * Have students write | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 | ... on the bottom of an index card spaced out about half an inch apart. Cut along the lines so that the numbers are each on a flap. 
        * Announce any number and have students fold up the note card sections such that the numbers showing add up to the desired number.
        * Write on the board what the decimal number announced now looks like in binary (e.g. 9 = 1001)
        * Repeat with additional numbers until all students understand.
    * Choose students to walk up to the front of the classroom. Have them hold the place they represent and have a 2^n on a sheet of paper (so student's have a 1 or 2 or 4 or ... written on their paper). Call out numbers and the students have to decide if their number should be held up (representing a "1") or not.
  * What else can be represented by binary? Answer (ANYTHING)
    * Picture example:
        * Show kids this photo : ![Stary Night](starynight.png), say these get put into 0/1
        * Hmm well that's a bit complicated, let's start with: ![city scape](basic_city.png)
        * Let's zoom in to pizel level: ![Pixel Level](Screen Shot 2015-11-24 at 12.19.32 PM.png)
        * We can imagine saying 1 is black and 0 is white.
    * All data get's converted into binary values! Even Music, video, and complex images!
  4. Discuss how everything the computer reads gets turned into binary in the end.
    1. How could letters be turned into binary? How can letters be turned into numbers? a = 1, b = 2, c = 3.
