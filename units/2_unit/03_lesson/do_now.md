#Do Now: 2.03

##Part 1
Open up the terminal. Type the following code into the interactive editor: 
```
 >>> 5 < 3
 >>> 5 > 3
 >>> type(5 < 3)
 >>> type(5 > 3) 
 >>> my_favorite_animal = "cats"
 >>> user_favorite_animal = input("What is your favorite animal? ") 
 >>> my_favorite_animal == user_favorite_animal
 ```
 What does `5 < 3` evaluate to? What do you think a boolean is? 
<br>
<br>
<br>

What is the difference between `==` and `=` ?
<br>
<br>
<br>

What data type do you think `my_favorite_animal == user_favorite_animal` is? 
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Part 2
Open up the terminal. Type the following code into the interactive editor. 
 ```
 >>> months_with_driving_permit = 6
 >>> age = 16
 >>> can_get_license = months_with_driving_permit >= 6 and age >= 16
 >>> print(can_get_license) 
 
```

What does `and` do here? What type do you think `can_get_license` is? 
<br>
<br>
<br>

Update the code to fit the new driving law: If you are over the age of 18 you don't need to have a permit. The other law still applies for people ages 16-18.
