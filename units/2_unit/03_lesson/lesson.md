# Lesson 2.03: Booleans & Expressions

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **evaluating, expressions, True, False**
* Evaluate a boolean expression
* Compose boolean expressions using `and`, `or`, `not`, `<`, `>`, and `==` 

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab] - Can I or Can't I?
* Associated Reading - section 2.2 of Book
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.

## Instructor's Notes
1. **Do Now** 
  * Project the Do Now on the board, circulate around the class to check that students are working and understand the instructions. 
2. **Lesson**
  * Ask students what they thought a Boolean was? 
    * If students are struggling. Ask them what values they saw? (answer should be `True` or `False`) 
    * Boolean expression: is an expression that evaluates to either true or false.
  * Ask Students about the difference between `=` and `==`. 
    * = is a setter for variables 
    * == builds a boolean expression
  * Remind students of boolean expressons in Snap! 
    ![Snap boolean Expressions](snap_boolean_expressions.png)
    * Ask the students to recall what `and`, `or` and `not` did.
  * Give students additional time to finish completing part 2 of the Do Now. 
  * Have a student write up the expression they used to update the `can_get_license` code.
    1.Poll students- how many boolean expressions are used? Answers here can vary but ~7 (age >= 16, age <18, driving_with_permit >=6, and expression, age > 18, or expression, whole expression) 
    2. Define composition: Using an expression as part of a larger expression, or a statement as part of a larger statement. You can use parenthesis to compose expressions as well
  5. Parenthesis: In SNAP! to compose many expressions they were nested together. In snap you can just put them one after another. However if you want certain things to evaluated together use parenthesis
3. **Lab**
    * Evaluate expressions with `and`, `or`, and `not`
    * Given written out rules, students will convert them into Boolean expressions.
    * Create a large expression using variables that describes you.

###Accommodation/Differentiation
If students are moving quickly, opportunity to go over truth tables (or ask them to research De Morgan's Law)
