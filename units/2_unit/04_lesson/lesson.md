# Lesson 2.04: Conditionals

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **if, else, elif, conditionals, flow of control** 
* Create chaining if statements
* Understand how conditional statements alter the flow of control of a program

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab] - Game Show
* Associated Reading - section 2.3 of Book
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Notes
1. **Do Now** 
  * Project the Do Now on the board, circulate around the class to check that students are working and understand the instructions. 
  * Students should quickly realize that they do not have all the tools necessary to complete the task.
  
2. **Lesson**
  * Ask students what they felt like they needed that they had in Snap!
    * Explain that in order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly. 
        * **Conditional** statements give us this ability. 
        * The simplest form is the if statement. The boolean expression after `if` is called the condition. If it is true, then the indented statement gets executed. If not, nothing happens.
```python
if x > 0: 
    print("x is positive")
```
  * Write out the syntax of if statement on the board. Point out: the Boolean expression(condition), the colon, and the tabbing. 
  * Ask students if they recall what else went along with the if statement.(else) 
    * else is used when there are two possibilities and the condition determines which one gets executed
    * show the syntax of the else
  * Describe the elif statment
    * Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. One way to express a computation like that is a chained conditional:
    * Show the syntax of elif
3. **Lab**
    * Students convert the triangle program written in snap into Python. 
    * Students must also write a program that simulates a list index using if statements. 

###Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, this lesson can move onto lists.
