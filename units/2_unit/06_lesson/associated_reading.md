# List operations
The + operator concatenates lists:
```
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
>>> c = a + b
>>> print c
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Similarly, the * operator repeats a list a given number of times:
```
>>> [0] * 4
[0, 0, 0, 0]
>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
```
The first example repeats [0] four times. The second example repeats the list [1, 2, 3] three times.
10.5  List slices

The slice operator works on lists:
```
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> t[1:3]
['b', 'c']
>>> t[:4]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> t[3:]
['d', 'e', 'f']
```
If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning. If you omit the second, the slice goes to the end. So if you omit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list.
```
>>> t[:]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```
Since lists are mutable, it is often useful to make a copy before performing operations that fold, spindle or mutilate lists.
A slice operator on the left side of an assignment can update multiple elements:
```
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']
>>> t[1:3] = ['x', 'y']
>>> print t
['a', 'x', 'y', 'd', 'e', 'f']
```

# List methods

Python provides methods that operate on lists. For example, append adds a new element to the end of a list:
```
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> t.append('d')
>>> print t
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
```

# Deleting elements

There are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you know the index of the element you want, you can use pop:
```
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> x = t.pop(1)
>>> print t
['a', 'c']
>>> print x
b
```

pop modifies the list and returns the element that was removed. If you donâ€™t provide an index, it deletes and returns the last element.

If you know the element you want to remove you can use remove:
```
>>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> t.remove('b')
>>> print t
['a', 'c']
```
