# Do Now 2.06

## Part 1
Open up the terminal. Type the following code using interactive mode
```
 a = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
 b = a[0:2]
 print(a)
 print(b)
 
```

What happens to a? What is b? What type is b? 
<br>
<br>
<br>
```
 a = [123, 'First Item', 456]
 a.remove('First Item')
 print(a) 
```

What does `remove` do? What would the length be after `remove`? 
<br>
<br>
<br>

```
 a = [123, 'First Item', 456]
 a.pop()
 print(a) 
```

What does `pop` do? What is the difference between `remove` and `pop`? 
<br>
<br>
<br>
```
 a = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
 b = a + ['Third Item']
 print(a)
 print(b)
 
```

What happens to a? What is b? What type is b? 
<br>
<br>
<br>

```
 a = []
 print(len(a))
 a.append('First Item')
 print(a)
 
```
What was the length of `[]`?
<br>
<br>
<br>

What does `append` do? What would the length be after `append`? 
<br>
<br>
