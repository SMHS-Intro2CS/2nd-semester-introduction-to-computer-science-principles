Rank the topics you find the most confusing:

1. Length of lists

2. Appending elements from a list

3. Indexing into Lists

4. Popping elements off a list

5. Slicing lists

6. Adding elements to a list

7. Creating lists

8. Removing elements from a list

Open up the terminal. How would you check if an item was in a three element list? 
```python
 a = ['cats', 'dogs', 'pigs']
 
```
<br>
<br>
<br>

What if the list was much longer? Try typing in the following code: 
```python
 a = ['cats', 'dogs', 'pigs']
 print('dogs' in a)
 print('cows' in a)
```
