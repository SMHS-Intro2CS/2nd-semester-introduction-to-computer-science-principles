## Instructor's Note
1. Lesson
  1. Go over list `is in` conditionals. Ask what the return value is (Boolean expression)
    1. Have students practice using the `is in` in an if statement. During this time look at the topics they are having problems
2. Review
    1. Review the topics students are confused about
    2. Have students practice using lists and Boolean expressions 
3. Opportunities for me: 
    1. This lesson may not be necessary, but the subject might need more time. 
    2. Quiz: there could also be a quiz after game loop or during the zork lesson
