## Instructor's Notes
1. Lesson
  * Go over list `is in` conditionals. Ask what the return value is (Boolean expression)
    * Have students practice using the `is in` in an if statement. During this time look at the topics they are having problems
2. Review
    * Review the topics students are confused about
    * Have students practice using lists and Boolean expressions 

###Accommodation/Differentiation 
This lesson may not be necessary, however this is a good opportunity to check for student understanding of lists and associated functions. 

There could also be a unit quiz after the game loop lesson or during the Zork project, and this lesson could be used to review for that quiz.
