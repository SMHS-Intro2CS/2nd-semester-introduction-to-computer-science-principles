## Instructor's Notes
1. **Project Overview/Demo** 
  * Distribute the project spec to all students and walk them through the goals and requirements of the project. 
  * Show a demo of a completed project.
  * Go over specific design considerations from the project spec: 
    * Draw out a game board using nested lists. Have students call out moves and practice going through a game.
    * Introduce the concept of global variables and how they will be useful here.
    * Identify the importance of the "User Pocket" and how to use a list along with `append` and `remove` for this information.
2. **Design**
    * Have students stay at their desks and write down what lists they'll need. 
    * They should break up the project into parts: parsing user input, keeping track of players position, returning what is at the player's position .
3. **Debrief/Review**
    * During discussion and warp up at the end of class, get a feeling for where students are in the project. 
    * During the review the next morning cover the topics/areas that students are struggling on and present tips, suggestions, and goals for that day.
