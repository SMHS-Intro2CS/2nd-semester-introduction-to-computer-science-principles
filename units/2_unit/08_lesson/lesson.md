# Lesson 2.08: Project 2

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Use knowledge of lists, booleans, conditionals, and while loops to create a text-based adventure game. 

##Materials/Preparation
* [Project Spec - Text Monster]
* [Text Monster Game - Example Code]
* Update the Project Spec as needed to meet your grading requirements
* Try creating your own variation on the Text Monster code so you are familiar with the potential challenges and bugs your students will hit.

## Instructor's Notes
1. **Project Overview/Demo** 
  * Distribute the project spec to all students and walk them through the goals and requirements of the project. 
  * Show a demo of a completed project.
  * Go over specific design considerations from the project spec: 
    * Draw out a game board using lists and a variable saving the current floor. Have students call out moves and practice going through a game. (Note using lists of lists ended up being too much info to cover here. If you think the students are ready it would make more sense design wise)
    * Introduce the concept of global variables and how they will be useful here.
    * Identify the importance of the "User Pocket" and how to use a list along with `append` and `remove` for this information.
2. **Design**
    * Have students stay at their desks and write down what lists they'll need. 
    * They should break up the project into parts: parsing user input, keeping track of players position, returning what is at the player's position .
3. **Debrief/Review**
    * During discussion and warp up at the end of class, get a feeling for where students are in the project. 
    * During the review the next morning cover the topics/areas that students are struggling on and present tips, suggestions, and goals for that day.

###Accommodation/Differentiation
Make sure to do status checks with all students throughout the project. Identify students that are struggling on the project after the first few days and provide additional scaffolding & support as needed. 
<br><br>
For any students that are advancing rapidly through the project, give them extension ideas such as adding a new feature or floor to the game. 
Advanced students can also be paired as tutors/helpers with struggling students.
