#Function calls

In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name. We have already seen one example of a function call:

```
>>> type(32)
<type 'int'>
```

The name of the function is type. The expression in parentheses is called the argument of the function. The result, for this function, is the type of the argument.
It is common to say that a function “takes” an argument and “returns” a result. The result is called the return value.

#Type conversion functions

Python provides built-in functions that convert values from one type to another. The int function takes any value and converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise:

```
>>> int('32')
32
>>> int('Hello')
ValueError: invalid literal for int(): Hello
```

int can convert floating-point values to integers, but it doesn’t round off; it chops off the fraction part:

```
>>> int(3.99999)
3
>>> int(-2.3)
-2
float converts integers and strings to floating-point numbers:
>>> float(32)
32.0
>>> float('3.14159')
3.14159
Finally, str converts its argument to a string:
>>> str(32)
'32'
>>> str(3.14159)
'3.14159'
```

# Math functions

Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar mathematical functions. A module is a file that contains a collection of related functions.

Before we can use the module, we have to import it:

```
>>> import math
This statement creates a module object named math. If you print the module object, you get some information about it:
>>> print math
<module 'math' (built-in)>
```

The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the module. To access one of the functions, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called dot notation.

```
>>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power
>>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)
```

```
>>> radians = 0.7
>>> height = math.sin(radians)
````

The first example uses log10 to compute a signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (assuming that signal_power and noise_power are defined). The math module also provides log, which computes logarithms base e.
The second example finds the sine of radians. The name of the variable is a hint that sin and the other trigonometric functions (cos, tan, etc.) take arguments in radians. To convert from degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply by 2 π:

```
>>> degrees = 45
>>> radians = degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi
>>> math.sin(radians)
0.707106781187
```

The expression math.pi gets the variable pi from the math module. The value of this variable is an approximation of π, accurate to about 15 digits.
If you know your trigonometry, you can check the previous result by comparing it to the square root of two divided by two:

```
>>> math.sqrt(2) / 2.0
0.707106781187
```

#Composition

So far, we have looked at the elements of a program—variables, expressions, and statements—in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.

One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks and compose them. For example, the argument of a function can be any kind of expression, including arithmetic operators:

```
x = math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi)
And even function calls:
x = math.exp(math.log(x+1))
```

Almost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary expression, with one exception: the left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name. Any other expression on the left side is a syntax error (we will see exceptions to this rule later).

```
>>> minutes = hours * 60                 # right
>>> hours * 60 = minutes                 # wrong!
SyntaxError: can't assign to operator
```
