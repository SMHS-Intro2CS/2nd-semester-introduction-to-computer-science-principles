#Lesson 3.02: User-Defined Functions

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **abstraction, def**
* Create functions

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab] - Birthday Song & Random Cards
* Associated Reading - section 3.2 of Book
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.

## Instructor's Notes
1. **Do Now**
2. **Lesson**
    * Ask students why a function is useful?
        * *Abstraction*: managing complexity of a program.
        * Less repeated code.
        * Consolidation of understanding.
    * Demonstrate to students how you create a function using *def*, showing syntax and arguments.
        * Ask students how they would call your example function.
    * Have students practice making a function that takes two arguments and adds them together. Saving both the variables as the sum in the function. 
    * Introduce concept of a function contract. Using `#` which adds a comment (non executed line of code)
        * Explain what the function will do, arguments it takes in (and their types)
3. **Lab**
    * Practice making a function that will take in a name as an argument and output the 'happy birthday song' to that name. 
    * Create a function that randomly selects 5 cards from a deck of cards (repeating allowed).
4. **Debrief**
    * Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions. 

###Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, they could go back and use functions to improve an old project.
