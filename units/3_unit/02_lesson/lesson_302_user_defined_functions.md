#Lesson 3.02: User-Defined Functions

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **abstraction, def**
* Create functions

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab]
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.

## Pacing Guide
| **Duration**   | **Description** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now      |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson      |
| 30 Minutes | Lab         |
| 5 Minutes | Debrief  |

## Instructor's Notes
1. **Do Now**
2. **Lesson**
    * Ask students why a function is useful?
        * *Abstraction*: managing complexity of a program.
        * Less repeated code.
        * Consolidation of understanding.
    * Demonstrate to students how you create a function using *def*, showing syntax and arguments.
    * Ask students how they would call your example function.
  4. Have students practice making a function that takes arguments and sum them. Saving both the variables as the sum in the function. 
  5. Introduce concept of a function contract. Using `#` which adds a comment (non executed line to code)
  	1. Explain what the function will do, arguments it takes in (and their types)
3. **Lab**
    1. Practice making a function that will take in a name, and sing 'happy birthday' to that name. 
    2. Create a function that randomly selects 5 cards from a deck of cards (repeating allowed)
4. **Debrief**
    * Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions. 

###Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, they could go back and use functions to improve an old project.
