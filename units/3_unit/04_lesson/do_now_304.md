# Do Now 3.04

Rank the following from easiest to hardest: 

1. importing
2. using `randint`
3. abstraction
4. passing int/str/float/bool arguments
5. calling a function 
6. list syntax
7. return vs print 

Is there any topic you would like to focus on and cover more of? 

Type the following into the terminal: 

```
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
# input: a list of strings
# output: None
def my_function(list_argument): 
	list_argument[0] = 'z'
print(my_list)
my_function(my_list)
print(my_list)
```
What happened? Try writing a similar program but passing in ints intead of a list. What happens?
