# Do Now

1. Copy and run the following code:
```python
single_fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'watermelon', 'grape']
multi_fruit = []
multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[0] + 's')
multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[1] + 's')
multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[2] + 's')
multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[3] + 's')
print(multi_fruit)
```
Briefly write down what happened. What would happen if you added 100 items to the list `single_fruit`? Write down how you would update `multi_fruit`.

2. Copy and run the following code:
```python
list_of_numbers = [3, 5, 10, 23]
for num in list_of_numbers: 
	print("num is " + str(num))
```
Briefly write down what happened. How would this change if you added 100 items to `list_of_numbers`?

3. Rewrite the code from part 1 using knowledge from part 2.
