#Lesson 4.01: Looping Basics

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **for loop**, **item**, **iteration**, **scope**
* Recall looping in Snap! and reapply the concept in Python 
* Loop through (traverse) the items in a list
* Be aware of the scope of variables during iteration 

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab]
* Associated Reading - section 4.1 of Book
*  Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Notes

1. **Do Now**
    * Display the Do Now on the board.
    * Students will experience how to use a for loop to efficiently complete a repeated action.
2. **Lesson**
	* Go over Part 1 of the Do Now. Ask the students what would happen if the list got much larger? 
	    * If they say they would write down a lot of code, ask how readable that might be, or how long would it take to write, or the greater potential for bugs due to typos.
	* Go over part 2 of the Do Now. Ask the students what happened. Ask if they remember something similar from Snap! and ask how the code would change if they added a 100 items to the list.
	* Introduce **for loop** as a way to deal with issues associated with part 1 of the Do Now. 
		* Syntax: `for num in list_of_numbers:`
		    * Emphasize that the body of for loop is the indented part
		* **Iteration**: body of the loop is repeated with different values of the list. Note how the body of loop is repeated but `num` changes. Consider drawing this out on the board. 
		* Remind students of the concept of **scope**, showing how `num` changes values with each iteration of the loop. 
	* Go Over Part 3 (students probably didn't finish). Ask students to write the first line of the loop on the board. Brainstorm what the body should be. Call on students. If struggling write up `multi_fruit.append(single_fruit[0] + 's')` from part 1 into the body of the  and ask a student to change it. Use print statements to show debugging. 
3. **Lab**
	* Count the vowels lab: Students will be given a sentence that they will need to print without vowels. 
4. **Debrief**
	* Talk about any issues. The students had. This is similar to the lab, but with building up a string so there might be some issues with adding back the spaces
	* Go over the bonus question. Explain a counter is frequently used to keep track of count of things from outside the loop . Discuss concept of counter's scope (counter get's updated in the loop, but doesn't reset automatically at each iteration). Counters can be used with any loop. Often used with while loops!
