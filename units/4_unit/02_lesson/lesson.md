#Lesson 4.02: For Loops, Nested Loops

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **range**, **nested**
* Use the range and len function to to update lists via for loops

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab] - Getting Loopy
* Associated Reading - section 4.2 of Book
* Read through the Do Now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Notes

1. **Do Now**
    * Display the Do Now on the board
    * Students experiment with and are introduced to the `range` function. 
2. **Lesson**
	* Go over Part 1 of the Do Now. Ask students what the range function did. Remind them that there are reference docs online. Show the docs for the range function (it actually takes in a third value that is optional). Work together with the students to write a for loop just using the range function. 
	* Go over part 2 of the Do Now. Ask the students what happened. Ask the students why these values might be helpful. (they are a list of the indices)
	* Go Over Part 3 (students probably didn't finish). Ask students to write the first line of the loop on the board. Work together to solve or have the students work at their desks. 
3. **Lab**
	* Students re-write the fruit plural program from yesterday's do now, but without creating a new list.
	* Students write a function that reverses the letters in a string
4. **Debrief**
	* Talk about any issues the students had with the lab today. Discuss how lists are mutable, so you don't have to return a new value. Instead, the list is just updated as the loop runs. 

###Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are having a hard time with the fruit pluralizer, consider altering the fruit program to not allow fruit that ends in y.

Some students may have issues with grabbing the last item of a string, consider providing tips or scaffolding for students that are struggling with this. 

Go over the bonus question if any students got to it. Discuss having a function inside of the loop and how that operated.
