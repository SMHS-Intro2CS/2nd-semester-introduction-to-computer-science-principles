## Instructor's Notes

1. **Quiz**
    * Have students start working on Quiz.
2. **Lesson**
	* Talk about how to read code in a loop (you can use something of your choice or the [Coding Example])
	* Go over debugging practices for loops. 
		* print statements, using the item to show where error is
		* altering input to make sure body of loop is working correctly
		* making sure lists don't go out of bounds/past the end of the list
3. **Lab**
	* This lab will have students read code and look for errors by reading through the code not at the computer		* After reading through the code they can practice debugging practices mentioned
4. **Debrief**
	* What was most helpful in debugging?
