# Lesson 4.06: Project 4

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Use project planning skills to complete a larger project
* Utilize loops, lists, and nested loops/lists to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game

##Materials/Preparation
* [Project Spec - Tic-Tac-Toe]
* Read through the handout, lesson, and project so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students
* Try creating your own variation on the Tic-Tac-Toe game so you are familiar with the potential challenges and bugs your students will hit

## Instructor's Note
1. **Do Now** 
	* Hand out the project spec and have students start reading through it.
2. **Project Overview**
 	* Demo the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
	* Go over all of the game rules and program requirements.
3. **Planning/Design**
    * Have students draw out game play and consider the overall design. 
        * How will they represent the board? 
        * How will they have users input their spots? 
        * Create functions for each user interaction.  
        * Figure out which variables are needed.
    * Have students plan out their next 7 days (suggested plan below):
    	1. set up game board, basic game loop asking players, and dummy functions for each players turn
    	2. create variables necessary to run the game, start implementing basic functions
    	3. focus on game play. Players should be able to play a game against each other
    	4. Create methods for checking if the game is over. Create a horizontal checker, vertical checker.
    	5. Create the diagonal checkers 
    	6. Connect the functions together
    	7. wrap up and game over check is correct
4. **Debrief**
	* Take time to go over questions and confusion relating to project requirements. 
	* Make sure to look over individual student project plans and check that they have outlined the project in a way that makes sense. 
5. **Day Plan**
	* At the start of class instead of a Do Now, have the student refer to their original project plan, write down what they hope to accomplish that day, and assess their schedule to see if they are on track.
6. **Review**
	* Go over any parts of the program that the majority of the class is struggling with. Provide scaffolding and tips to students that are not on track for completion.
	 

###Accommodation/Differentiation
Students can create a variable size board

The checker can actually be done using one function taking in the start x and y and the movement of the x and y.
