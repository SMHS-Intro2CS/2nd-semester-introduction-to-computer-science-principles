# Lab 5.02: EarSketch Music 


1. Starting with an empty script, try to add your own makeBeat call, and add it to measure 1 in track 1. You will have to choose your own clip, and make a beat string. The EarSketch Sound Browser contains a type of clip designed for use with makeBeat: one-shots. These are typically the length of one drum hit. Now, try calling makeBeat several times (with different measure number arguments) to repeat your pattern. You could even add a complementary rhythm on a new track.
2. Create your own song that uses: 
	* 2 calls to `fitMedia()`
	* 2 calls to `makeBeat()`
	* 1 call to `setEffect()`
