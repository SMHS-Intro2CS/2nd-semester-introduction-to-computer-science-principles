#Lesson 5.02: EarSketch Music

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **rhythm**, **beat**, **tempo**, **measures**, **setEffect()**, **makeBeat()**
* Playing beats using the functions
* Loop through items in a list
* Be aware of the scope of variables during iteration 

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Lab]
*  Read through the Do Now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Notes

1. **Do Now**
    * Display the Do Now on the board
2. **Lesson**
	* Ask what phrases the students wrote down or remembered from the reading. 
		* **rhythm** of a song, we are describing how the music moves through time.
		* A **beat** is the basic unit of time in music. If you have ever clapped along to a song, you were probably clapping on each beat. So how long does a beat last? The length depends on the overall speed of the song, called the tempo. **Tempo** is measured in beats per minute (bpm). If we are clapping at 60 bpm, then each beat lasts one second. At 120 bpm, each beat takes half a second. The higher the bpm, the faster the song, the shorter the duration of each beat.
		* Beats are grouped into **measures**. In EarSketch, measures always have four beats.
		* **setEffect()**: add an effect to a track. Takes parameters: track number, effect name, effect parameter, effect value
		* **makeBeat()**: instead of composing at the measure-level, we can work at the note-level. Takes parameters: clip name, track number, measure number, beat string
3. **Lab**
	* Follow the ear sketch instructions below `makeBeat()` 
	* Create a simple song with 2 uses of fitMedia, 2 uses of makeBeat and 1 use of effect. 
	* Students can use looping and if statements if they would like 
4. **Debrief**
	* Talk about new functions, questions about data types and using strings.
