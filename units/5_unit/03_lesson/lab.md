# Lab 5.03: Earsketch Control Flow

1. Single Track Song. Create a song that uses the following: 
	* Using at least 1 loop of `fitMedia`, `makeBeat()`, and `setEffect`
	* Use a conditional statement to add some variance to your for loop. 
2. Create a multi-track song with the following: 
	* Using at least 1 loop of `fitMedia`, `makeBeat()`, and `setEffect`
	* Use a conditional statement to add some variance to your for loop. 
	* play around with `makeBeat()` to construct a few different beat strings. 
	* make a list of the beat strings and use these in the song as well.
