## Instructor's Notes

1. **Do Now**
    * Display the Do Now on the board
2. **Lesson**
	* Ask what phrases the students wrote down or remembered from the reading. 
		* **Section**: generally refers to several measures of music (often 2, 4, 8, or 16 measures) that sound like a single musical unit
		* **A-B-A Form**: a song divided into three sections:
			* Section A: measures 1-4.
			* Section B: measures 5-7. Features contrasting sounds to Section A.
			* Section A (repeated): measures 7-10.
	* Ask students about returning the measure number. Go over the concept of passing around the measure number and make sure students understand how it would be helpful. (Since it allows you to change how long/short sections are without updating every function)
3. **Lab**	
	* Show the song with a form [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU)
	* Asks students to make their own song with the form AABA. Have them create a song with that format
4. **Debrief**
	* Talk about any of the phrases or issues the students had. Did they find it easy to understand the code when they read it.
