# Do Now: Dictionaries Storing Lists

1.Type and run the following code in the interpreter. 

```
list_dictionaries = {
	'cat': [1, 3, 4],
	'is': [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
print(list_dictionaries['cat'])
```

Write down what type list_dictionaries is, what type the key is, and what type the value is. 

2.Write code so that the value of 'is' becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
