##Looping and dictionaries

If you use a dictionary in a for statement, it traverses the keys of the dictionary. For example, print_hist prints each key and the corresponding value:

```
def print_hist(h):
    for c in h:
        print c, h[c]
```

Hereâ€™s what the output looks like:

```
>>> h = histogram('parrot')
>>> print_hist(h)
a 1
p 1
r 2
t 1
o 1
```

Again, the keys are in no particular order.

Dictionaries have a method called keys that returns the keys of the dictionary, in no particular order, as a list.
