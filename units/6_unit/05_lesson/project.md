# Project: Guess Who

In Guess Who, you’ll be building a text version of the classic board game. Dictionaries will be the key to this project. [

## Overview
The game should store information on at least 5 characters. Each character should have a name, gender, age, height, and hair color.

When the game begins, a character should be randomly selected. The player can ask for 2 pieces of information, and then has to make a guess who was picked.

### Behavior
* list: list out all the characters and their information 
* gender|age|height|hair: asks for a piece of information 
* guess <name>: guess a character
* help: displays all commands
* quit: exits the game

### Implementation Details
* To store and access the information you’ll need to use dictionaries. They’ll allow quick and direct access.
