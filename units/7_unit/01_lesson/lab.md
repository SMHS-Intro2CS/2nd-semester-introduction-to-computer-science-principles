# Lab : Creating Classes

In this lab we will create a class that will represent colors and build a function to combine two colors. 

### Background 
RGB is a way of storing coloring data. R stands for red, G stands for green, and B stands for blue. Each color is given a value from 0 to 255. 

You can use this tool to see what different colors are:[http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm](http://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.htm)
