# Lesson: User Defined Types

##Learning Objectives
Students will be able to... 
* Define and identify: **class**, **instance**, **object**, **attributes**
* Create a class and instantiate 
* Add attributes to an instance
* Use attributes and class

##Materials/Preparation
* [Do Now]
* [Example]
* [Lab]
* Read through the handout, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Note

1. **Do Now**
    * Display the Do Now on the board.
2. **Lesson**
	* Discuss Do Now
		* Ask the students what data type they thought would be helpful? Ask how they would print the full names. 
		* Need something that says "I am type Pet"
	* **class**: a user defined type. 
		* On board write syntax for creating a class: `class Pet(object):`
		* **object** : basis of object oriented programming. objects correspond to a real world object
		* instantiated: can create **instances** of a class by using `Pet()`. If you check the type of an instance it will be Pet
		* instances are mutable, they can be changed or updated 
	* show [Example] on board.
	 	* Ask students what the difference is between this and the do now
	 	* Ask the students where the class is created. 
	 	* Ask the students where the class is instantiated
		* Ask students what they think `pet.full_name` will do
			* explain concept of attribute
			* **attribute**: values assigned to an instance 
	* can also create functions that take in classes and use their attributes 
3. **Lab**	
	* Students will create RGB colors using class.
	* Create a function to merge two colors.  
	* Check up their colors on a rgb website 
4. **Debrief**
	* Talk about any of the phrases or issues the students had. Did they find it easy to understand the code when they read it.
