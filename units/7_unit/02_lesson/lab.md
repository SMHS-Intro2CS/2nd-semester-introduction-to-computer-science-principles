# Lab

In this lab we will build off of our pet class. To create a Pet class that will keep track of the type of animal, color, food, noise and name of a given animal. We will utilize classes. 

1. Create a class called Pet. That will have the following attributes: 
	* type (i.e. dog, cat, fish)
	* color (i.e. spotted, black, tabby, white)
	* food (i.e. kibbles, tuna, fish flakes)
	* noise (i.e. meow, woof, bark)
	* name (i.e. Sparky, Scooby Doo)
2. Make sure to use the `__init__` method to create these attributes
3. Create a list of pets
4. Create a function that takes in a list of pets and prints out the name and the food attributes
5. Test your function with your list of pets
