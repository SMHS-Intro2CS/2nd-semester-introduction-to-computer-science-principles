[# Project: Pokemon

In this project we will be creating a basic implementation of Pokemon, and then create a game for them to battle.

This project will have three steps. The Pokemon Classes, the User classes, and the game loop.

##Overview
You will create 9 Pokemon. Each Pokemon comes from 1 of 3 types: grass, fire, and water. The types of Pokemon will be represented by classes. You will be given a base Pokemon class which the grass, fire, and water classes will inherit from. All Pokemon of the same type have the same set of attacks, and each individual one has a specific hp (hit points), pp(power points), and name.

After creating the list of Pokemon (details given below), you will create a user and computer class. You will be given a bare bones implementation of the base user class. The computer class should inherit from the user class. The computer class will need to overwrite certain methods of the user class. 

After implementing the user and computer classes you will need to write a game loop. Before the battle begins, the program should ask the user's name and what the user wants the computer's name to be. The program should also ask the user to pick 3 Pokemon for their hand, and randomly select the computer's Pokemon from the remaining Pokemon. Then the program should ask the user which Pokemon they would like to use in battle as their current Pokemon. The program should randomly select one for the Computer. After that the battle begins. 

Each turn the user will be given the option to `attack`, `heal`, or `switch`. If the computer is playing one of these will be randomly selected, but should more frequently attack. 

`attack`: gives the user the options of the attacks the Pokemon has and asks the user to pick one. An attack has a name, and corresponds to a list of the power of the attack and the accuracy. The attack should be a random number in the range between the `attack power(or the pp if that is lower than the attack power) - 20` and the `attack power (or the pp if that is lower than the attack power)`, the attack should also randomly fail according to the attack's accuracy. The attack should decrease the enemy's hp, and print out a useful description. On the computer's turn randomly select an attack to use in the battle. 

`heal`: gives 20 HP back to the current Pokemon, but takes away the turn

`switch`: Lists the stats (HP, AP, Name) of all pokemon in the hand, and then switches the current Pokemon, but takes away the turn. On the computers turn if this option is randomly selected, choose a random Pokemon to switch with. 

If either the user's or the computer's current Pokemon is out of HP, they will be required to switch Pokemon. If there are no available Pokemon, that player has lost. 

Continue looping until one player has lost. 

### Behaviour
#### Game Play
* Ask the user to choose 3 Pokemon: At the beginning of the game the program will list out the pokemon to choose from. Options are the following, HP stands for the health points the pokemon has and AP says the max value of attack 
	* Grass Type: 
		* Bulbasoar: 60HP, 40AP
		* Bellsprout: 40HP, 60AP
		* Oddish: 50HP, 50AP
	* Fire Type: 
		* Charmainder: 25HP, 70AP
		* Ninetails: 30HP, 50AP
		* Ponyta: 40HP, 60AP
	* Water Type:
		* Squirtle: 80HP, 20AP
		* Psyduck: 70HP, 40AP
		* Polywag: 50HP, 50AP
* Ask the user to choose Pokemon to use in fight
* Generate Computer's Hand and randomly select a pokemon to start
* On each turn the player or computer can either `attack`, `heal`, or `switch` 
* At the end of each the turn print out the HP of the current Pokemon, and check if either side has lost the game 
* A player has lost if all their Pokemon are out of HP
* `switch`: Lists the stats (HP, AP, Name) of all Pokemon in the hand, and asks the user what Pokemon they would like to switch to. Cannot attack until next turn.  
* `stats`: Lists all the stats of the Pokemon in the hand
* `heal`: adds 20 hp to the current Pokemon, cannot attack until next turn
* `attack`: lists all attacks of current Pokemon, prompts the user pick an attack and then inflicts that damage on the Computer's current pokemon. If this K.Os the enemy then the Computer must switch Pokemon on their next turn. 
Should print out the following: 

``` python
>>> Ash is attacking. Bulbosaur used Bubble and did 20 damage. 
```

#### Computer 
* Computer will select between the three options. 2/3 the time they should file. 1/6 of the time they should heal and 1/6 of the time they should switch pokemon. 
* `attack`: Will randomly select an attack and do damage to the User's current Pokemon. 
* `heal`: WIll heal current Pokemon by 20 HP, but cannot attack that turn. 
* `switch`: switched current Pokemon, but cannot attack. 

### Pokemon Attacks
All Pokemon of the same type have the same Attacks. 

#### Grass Type 
All grass type have the following attacks: 
	* Leaf Storm: 130 Power, 90% accurate
	* Mega Drain: 50 Power, 100% accurate
	* Razor Leaf: 55 Power, 95% accurate
Grass Type is 1.5x stronger against Water Type.

#### Fire Type 
All fire type have the following attacks: 
	* Ember: 60 Power, 100% accurate
	* Fire Punch: 85 Power, 80% accurate
	* Flame Wheel: 70 Power, 90% accurate 
Fire Type is 1.5x stronger against Grass. 

#### Water Type 
All fire type have the following attacks: 
	* Bubble: 40 Power, 100% accurate
	* Hydro Pump: 185 Power, 30% accurate
	* Surf: 70 Power, 90% accurate 
Water Type is 1.5x stronger against Fire Types. 

### Implementation Details
* Use classes to build off the implemented base class for Pokemon. Keep track of HP, Max AP, and type.
	- [starter_code]
* Design classes for Fire, Grass, Water Types that inherit from the base Pokemon Class
* Each Pokemon should be an instance, use a master list to store all the Pokemon and create this the beginning of the game
* Use methods to set the Pokemon for each player and remove those pokemon from the master Pokemon list. 
* Player's and Computer's Pokemon should be stored using a list
* Pokemon attacks should be stored using a dictionary from the attack name to a list of [attack's power, attack's accuracy]

### Check Point 1
Implement the following: 
* `get_attack_power` on Pokemon class
* `attack` on Pokemon class
* `take_damage` on Pokemon class
* `heal` on Pokemon class
* Grass, Fire, and Water type classes
* `set_type` on Fire, Water and Grass classes
* `set_attacks` on Fire, Water and Grass classes
* `get_attack_power` on Fire, Water, and Grass classes

### Check Point 2
Implement the following: 
* `list_pokemon` on User Class
* `switch` on User Class
* `heal` on User Class
* `is_end_game` on User Class
* `print_attacks` on USer Class
* `attack` on User Class
* Computer class
* `play_turn` on Computer class
* `set_pokemon` on Computer Class
* `attack` on Computer Class
* `switch` on Computer Class

### Check Point 3
Implement the following
* a game loop
* inputs that ask if user would like to attack, heal or switch
* call correct player function based on inputs
* check for the end of the game and end game if necessary
